Online Chessboard
=================

An online chessboard made with Spring, JSF 2 and Primefaces. [Flux Chess](http://fluxchess.com/)is used as chess engine. 
The [rule engine](https://github.com/schildbach/de.schildbach.game) is from Andreas Schildbach.

This is a "just-for-fun-project". Unfortunately it's not installed on any public server at the moment.
